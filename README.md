You have been tasked with coming up with a front page design for a client. You can choose from one of the two following clients (see file download above for logos or create your own logo!)

Cute Cappuccino's Coffee Shop
Jerry & Tom's Garage
The direction and design you choose to take are completely up to you but the page must have the following:

One working design for a "Home" page
Responsive (3 breakpoints minimum)
jQuery plugin (at least one)
Logo
Consistent look and feel
Navigational links for at least the following "Home", "About Us", "Services" and "Contact" (these don't have to actually link anywhere, just make them links and use a hashtag (#) in the href, ie: <a href="#">Home</a>
 

Remember, this is a design challenge. Start with pencil and paper to make some quick design ideas and sketches. Move into Photoshop and build out a polished look and feel. Finish by turning the Photoshop design into a working, properly coded website, the same way you did with Scalleywags.
